# Welcome to ChristianBirchler.org
This is an organization account I use to manage all reposotories and collaborators consisting of mainly students that contribute to the Software Engineering Research.

## Organization
- For each research project;
  - a separate project instance is opened from which we manage all project-related repositories' issues.
  - a team is created consisting of all co-authors
  - a repository based on the `research-repository-template` is created where all results are generated in a reproducable manner
  - a design artifact repository is created where the code of the actual tool/framework is located
